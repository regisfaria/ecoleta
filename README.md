# Ecoleta 

## Notes
  **REMEMBER:** To run the project,I must always use below code, because I mainly use npm v8 for other dev.
  ```shell
  $ nvm use 12
  ```

## Overview 
  In this project you can find a Web/Mobile SPA(Single Page Application) for a garbage selective collect. In this project you can register selective collection places, where users of the app can quickly find nearest collection nodes to deliver all their selective garbage.
  We've bee thought a API REST, Web and a Mobile application. All working alongside each other.
  
  In a near future I intend to make a similar version of this app, but for another purpose.
  This project was written following the NLW(Next Level Week) dev week online free course from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

  **IMPORTANT**: The BUILD_PROJECT shell script was done for my personal use, so It will only work on your machine if you're using Linux **and** have a local server installed locally.
